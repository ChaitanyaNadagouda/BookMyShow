# BookMyShow Backend Low-Level Design

This repository showcases a low-level design implementation of the backend part of BookMyShow, focusing on features like user login and show booking. The project is built using Maven, Spring Boot, and utilizes database handling with schemas defined via annotations.

# Features
Booking shows
User sign-up
User login using Spring Security
Password encryption using BCryptGenerator
Show Booking: Enables users to search for shows, select seats, and book tickets for desired shows.
Concurrency Handling: Implements isolation level of serializable to handle concurrent booking requests effectively.
DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Demonstrates the usage of request and response DTOs for communication between the frontend and backend.

# Technologies Used

Maven: For project management and dependency resolution.
Spring Boot: Provides a framework for building robust and scalable applications.
Hibernate: Handles database operations and schema definitions via annotations.
MySQL/PostgreSQL: Database systems used for storing user and show information.

# Prerequisites
Java JDK installed on your system
Maven installed on your system
MySQL database server installed and running

# Still to Explore
While this project provides a good starting point, it's important to note that it's not a complete end-to-end backend solution for BookMyShow. Here are some areas you may want to explore further:

Enhanced User Authentication: Implement additional security features such as email verification, password reset functionality, etc.
Show Management: Add functionalities to manage shows, theaters, and movie details.
Booking Enhancements: Enhance the booking system with features like seat selection, payment integration, etc.
User Profiles: Implement user profiles where users can view their booking history, upcoming shows, etc.
Integration Testing: Write comprehensive integration tests to ensure the reliability of the application.
Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate a payment gateway for processing ticket payments securely.
Email Notifications: Implement email notifications for booking confirmations, reminders, etc.
Analytics and Reporting: Incorporate features for analyzing user behavior and generating reports for business insights.
Scalability: Explore techniques for scaling the application to handle a large number of concurrent users and transactions efficiently.

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding new features, improving existing ones, or addressing any issues you encounter. Happy coding!
