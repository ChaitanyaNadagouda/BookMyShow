#BookMyShow Backend Low-Level Design

This repository showcases a low-level design implementation of the backend part of BookMyShow, focusing on features like user login and show booking. The project is built using Maven, Spring Boot, and utilizes database handling with schemas defined via annotations.

#Features
Show Booking: Enables users to search for shows, select seats, and book tickets for desired shows.
Concurrency Handling: Implements isolation level of serializable to handle concurrent booking requests effectively.
DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Demonstrates the usage of request and response DTOs for communication between the frontend and backend.

#Technologies Used

Maven: For project management and dependency resolution.
Spring Boot: Provides a framework for building robust and scalable applications.
Hibernate: Handles database operations and schema definitions via annotations.
MySQL/PostgreSQL: Database systems used for storing user and show information.

#Running the Project

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Maven and JDK installed.
Configure the database connection properties in application.properties.
Build the project using Maven: mvn clean install.
Run the application: java -jar target/bookmyshow-backend.jar.

#What You Can Learn

Backend Logic: Understand how various backend functionalities are implemented, including user authentication and show booking.
Database Handling: Explore database schema design and interaction with Spring Boot using Hibernate.
Concurrency Management: Learn about handling concurrent requests in a transactional environment.
DTO Usage: Gain insights into using DTOs for request/response handling, improving communication between frontend and backend.

#Still to Explore
While this project provides a good starting point, it's important to note that it's not a complete end-to-end backend solution for BookMyShow. Here are some areas you may want to explore further:

Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate a payment gateway for processing ticket payments securely.
Email Notifications: Implement email notifications for booking confirmations, reminders, etc.
Analytics and Reporting: Incorporate features for analyzing user behavior and generating reports for business insights.
Scalability: Explore techniques for scaling the application to handle a large number of concurrent users and transactions efficiently.

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding new features, improving existing ones, or addressing any issues you encounter. Happy coding!
